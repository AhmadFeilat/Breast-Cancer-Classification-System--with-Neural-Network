 Breast Cancer with Neural Network (Assignment-06)
- In this dataset, I am building a system that can classify whether a tumor is malignant or benign using breast cancer diagnostic data.
- I am using a Neural Network model built with TensorFlow and Keras.
- The model is designed using a Sequential architecture with Dense layers, and the data is preprocessed using Standard Scaling to improve model performance. 
- The system is trained and tested using a standard train-test split to evaluate its accuracy and classification capability.
